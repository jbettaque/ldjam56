> A game about building up a base and have lots of tiny creatures battle it out created during the [Ludum Dare 56](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56). 

In ###, you have to carefully balance between building new structures and upgrading them, while also spawning creatures to defend your base. The enemy is doing the same - may the better stategist win!
